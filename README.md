Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room. The client wanted to expand their gaming platform for their game, Draw It Or Lose It. They wanted to allow users to play the game on multiple platforms rather than just their current Andriod-only version. The Gaming room wished to design their game based on their current Android application and help with environmental setup and streamlining development. My team would create the game from a cross-platform approach. Each game and team name needed to be unique. The game also should only allow one instance of the game at a time in memory. My team was asked to design the game to have more than one player per team, and the game had to have the ability to have multiple or single teams playing per game.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

According to the feedback received from my instructor, my evaluations flowed nicely into my recommendations and were backed up with good thought processes. I blended both general and specific recommendations, specifically in the security section.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

While working through the design document, I discovered coding became easier to write. I suspect this is due to my being able to formulate my thoughts into something that could be read and being able to execute according to what I had written down. Seeing my thoughts through words and diagrams was highly beneficial, as it allowed me to correctly write the code needed to execute my ideas into reality. Design documents are a must!

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Though I am proud of the work I did on the design document. I am humble enough to know it wasn't perfect and could use improvements. Specifically, I would revise the layout of the design document. Though I agree that it makes sense and flows well, creating an entire section about the edits in the code is crucial. I didn't put that into the document anywhere. If someone other than me were to read that and write code based on that, it would be a struggle.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I will use what the client wrote to me and their requirements. I interpreted what was possible and wrote down possibilities and choices for them to choose. Overall, I do a good job of relaying what someone needs and offering opportunities to make their ideas into something executable. Analytical and abstract thought are instrumental skills to help people realize their ideas. Those two skills are imperative for designing because if you cannot understand what the user needs and give them a product, they will no longer be able to have the product they wish to have. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing this software with an open mind, eagerness to learn, and humbleness to fail. Google and YouTube were instrumental in helping me understand concepts and coding syntax. In the future, I would approach this like I did here with a growth mindset, problem-solving skills, and a ton of research. Sitting down for a couple of hours daily, hyper-focusing on a concept to understand something better, was extremely helpful!
